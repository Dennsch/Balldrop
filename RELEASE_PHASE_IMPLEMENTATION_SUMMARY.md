# Hard Mode Release Phase Implementation Summary

## Overview
The release phase in Hard Mode has been implemented to ensure that each ball can only be released once, and players can only release balls from columns they reserved in the first phase.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Game Logic (src/Game.ts)

#### Updated `releaseBall()` method:
- **One-time release**: Each ball can only be released once by removing the column from the reserved list after release
- **Ownership validation**: Players can only release balls from columns they reserved
- **Proper tracking**: Decreases `ballsRemaining` and removes column from `reservedColumns` array

#### Updated `canReleaseBall()` method:
- Checks if column was originally reserved by the player
- Verifies that the column still has unreleased balls (exists in reserved columns list)
- Ensures column is not full

### 2. User Interface (src/GameUI.ts)

#### Enhanced `updatePlayerInfo()`:
- **Column Reservation Phase**: Shows reservation progress (X/Y columns reserved)
- **Ball Placement Phase**: Shows placement progress (X/Y balls placed)
- **Ball Release Phase**: Shows release progress (X/Y balls released)
- **Clear messaging**: Provides appropriate instructions for each phase

#### Enhanced `updateColumnSelectors()`:
- **Visual indicators**: Different styles for reserved columns by each player
- **Phase-appropriate display**: Shows reservation info, placement status, or release availability
- **Color coding**: Player 1 (red) and Player 2 (blue) reserved columns

#### Enhanced `updateGameStatus()`:
- **Phase-specific messages**: Clear instructions for each phase
- **Release phase guidance**: "Click any of your reserved columns to release balls. Each ball can only be released once."

#### Enhanced `updateHardModeUI()`:
- **Dynamic UI elements**: Shows/hides execute button based on current phase
- **Progress tracking**: Displays reservation, placement, and release progress
- **State-appropriate controls**: Only shows relevant buttons for current phase

### 3. Visual Styling (styles.css)

#### Added reserved column styles:
- `.reserved-p1`: Red styling for Player 1 reserved columns
- `.reserved-p2`: Blue styling for Player 2 reserved columns
- **Hover effects**: Enhanced visual feedback for interactive columns
- **Border indicators**: Clear visual distinction for reserved columns

## Game Flow in Hard Mode

### Phase 1: Column Reservation
- Players alternate reserving columns (one per turn)
- Each column can only be reserved once
- Visual indicators show which player reserved each column

### Phase 2: Ball Placement
- Players place balls in their reserved columns only
- Balls are placed as "dormant" and don't fall immediately
- Progress tracking shows placement status

### Phase 3: Ball Release ⭐ **NEW IMPLEMENTATION**
- **No turn-based play**: Players can release balls at any time
- **One-time release**: Each ball can only be released once
- **Ownership restriction**: Players can only release from their reserved columns
- **Visual feedback**: Reserved columns show which player can release from them
- **Progress tracking**: Shows how many balls each player has released

## Key Behaviors Verified

✅ **Each ball can only be released once**
- After releasing a ball from a column, that column is removed from the player's reserved list
- Subsequent attempts to release from the same column will fail

✅ **Players can only release from their reserved columns**
- `canReleaseBall()` validates column ownership
- UI only enables buttons for columns the current player can release from

✅ **Release phase behaves like normal mode**
- No turn-based restrictions during release
- Players can release balls in any order
- Game ends when all balls are released

✅ **Proper UI feedback**
- Clear visual indicators for reserved columns
- Progress tracking for all phases
- Appropriate messaging for each game state

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- Logic correctness (`test_release_phase_simple.js`)
- Browser integration (`test_release_phase_browser.html`)
- UI behavior and visual feedback

The implementation ensures that the release phase maintains the strategic depth of Hard Mode while providing the fluid gameplay experience of normal mode once balls are being released.
