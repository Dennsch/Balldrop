# Turn-Based Release Phase Implementation

## Overview
The release phase in Hard Mode now behaves **exactly like normal mode** with turn-based play, but with two key restrictions:
1. Players can only use their reserved columns
2. Each column can only be used once

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Game Logic (src/Game.ts)

#### Updated `releaseBall()` method:
- **Turn-based restriction**: Added check `if (columnOwner !== this.currentPlayer)` to ensure only the current player can release balls
- **One-time use**: Each column is removed from the reserved list after use
- **No immediate grid application**: Like normal mode, the ball path is calculated but not applied until animation completes
- **Animation callback**: Triggers `onBallDropped` for proper animation handling

#### Added `completeBallRelease()` method:
- **Grid application**: Applies the ball path to the grid after animation completes
- **Sound effects**: Plays impact sound when ball settles
- **Turn switching**: Switches to the next player after successful release (like normal mode)
- **Game completion**: Checks if game is finished and updates state accordingly

#### Updated `canReleaseBall()` method:
- **Turn validation**: Only allows current player to release from their columns
- **Column availability**: Checks if column still has unreleased balls
- **Ownership validation**: Ensures column was reserved by the current player

#### Updated `dropBall()` method:
- **Release phase handling**: Redirects to `releaseBall()` when in release phase

### 2. User Interface (src/GameUI.ts)

#### Enhanced `animateBallPath()` method:
- **State-aware completion**: Uses `completeBallRelease()` for release phase, `completeBallDrop()` for normal play
- **Consistent animation**: Same animation system as normal mode
- **Error handling**: Proper cleanup and completion even if animation fails

#### Updated `updatePlayerInfo()` method:
- **Turn display**: Shows current player's turn in release phase
- **Ball count**: Displays remaining balls (like normal mode)
- **Clear messaging**: "Player X's Turn - Release from your reserved columns"

#### Updated `updateGameStatus()` method:
- **Turn-based messaging**: "Take turns releasing balls from your reserved columns"
- **Clear instructions**: Emphasizes turn-based nature and one-time use

#### Enhanced `updateHardModeUI()` method:
- **Current turn indicator**: Shows whose turn it is prominently
- **Remaining balls**: Displays balls remaining for each player
- **Turn emphasis**: Highlights the current player

### 3. Visual Feedback (styles.css)

#### Reserved column styling:
- **Player colors**: Red for Player 1, Blue for Player 2
- **Turn highlighting**: Green border for available columns on current player's turn
- **Disabled state**: Grayed out columns that can't be used

## Game Flow in Release Phase

### Turn-Based Mechanics:
1. **Player 1 starts**: Game begins with Player 1's turn
2. **Column restriction**: Player can only click their reserved columns
3. **One release per turn**: Player releases one ball, then turn switches
4. **Turn alternation**: Players alternate until all balls are released
5. **Game completion**: Game ends when both players have 0 balls remaining

### Validation Rules:
- ✅ **Current player only**: `canReleaseBall()` checks if it's the player's turn
- ✅ **Reserved columns only**: Player can only use columns they reserved
- ✅ **One-time use**: Each column is removed after use
- ✅ **Turn switching**: Turn switches after each successful release

## Comparison with Normal Mode

| Aspect | Normal Mode | Hard Mode Release Phase |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Turn-based play | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Column restrictions | ❌ Any available column | ✅ Only reserved columns |
| Column reuse | ❌ One ball per column | ❌ One ball per column |
| Turn switching | ✅ After each ball | ✅ After each ball |
| Animation system | ✅ Full animation | ✅ Same animation system |
| Sound effects | ✅ Pop + Impact | ✅ Pop + Impact |
| Game completion | ✅ When all balls used | ✅ When all balls used |

## Testing Results

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with the following scenarios:

### ✅ Turn-Based Validation:
- Only current player can release balls
- Turn switches after each successful release
- Players cannot act out of turn

### ✅ Column Restrictions:
- Players can only use their reserved columns
- Cannot use opponent's columns
- Cannot use unreserved columns

### ✅ One-Time Use:
- Each column can only be used once
- Column is removed from available list after use
- Cannot reuse the same column

### ✅ Game Flow:
- Proper turn alternation
- Correct ball count tracking
- Game ends when all balls are released

## Summary

The release phase now provides the **exact same gameplay experience as normal mode** with the strategic constraints of Hard Mode:

- **Familiar mechanics**: Players who know normal mode will immediately understand the release phase
- **Strategic depth**: The column reservation phase adds planning and strategy
- **Fair play**: Turn-based system ensures both players get equal opportunities
- **Clear feedback**: UI clearly shows whose turn it is and what columns are available

This implementation successfully bridges the gap between the strategic setup phases of Hard Mode and the familiar gameplay of normal mode.
