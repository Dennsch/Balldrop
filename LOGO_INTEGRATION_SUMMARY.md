# Logo Integration and Color System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated a logo into the Balldrop Game header and implemented a comprehensive color system that harmonizes with the logo design. The implementation maintains all existing game functionality while enhancing the visual design and brand consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Structure Updates (`index.html`)

#### Header Restructuring
- Added `header-content` wrapper div for better layout control
- Created `logo-container` div to house the logo image
- Integrated logo image element with proper attributes:
  ```html
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b96917f5-2137-4a87-a570-afd95931905a" 
       alt="Balldrop Game Logo" 
       class="game-logo">
  ```
- Maintained semantic HTML structure and accessibility

### 2. CSS Color System Implementation (`styles.css`)

#### Brand Color Variables
Added comprehensive CSS custom properties system:
```css
:root {
    /* Brand Colors - Based on Logo */
    --brand-primary: #2E86AB;      /* Deep blue - primary brand color */
    --brand-secondary: #A23B72;    /* Deep magenta - secondary brand color */
    --brand-accent: #F18F01;       /* Orange accent - for highlights */
    --brand-success: #C73E1D;      /* Red-orange - for success states */
    
    /* Player Colors - Harmonized with brand */
    --player-1-color: #E63946;     /* Vibrant red - Player 1 */
    --player-2-color: #457B9D;     /* Ocean blue - Player 2 */
    
    /* UI Colors */
    --background-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--brand-primary) 0%, var(--brand-secondary) 100%);
    --surface-color: #FFFFFF;
    --text-primary: #1D3557;
    --text-light: #FFFFFF;
    /* ... and more */
}
```

#### Logo Styling
