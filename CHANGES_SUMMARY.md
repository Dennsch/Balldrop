# Ball Redirection Fix - Changes Summary

## Problem Identified
The original ball redirection logic in `Grid.ts` was incorrect. When a ball hit a box:
1. The box direction was flipped FIRST
2. Then the ball was redirected based on the NEW (flipped) direction

This meant that if a ball hit a RIGHT arrow box, the box would flip to LEFT, and then the ball would be redirected LEFT - which is counterintuitive.

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the logic in `Grid.ts` `dropBall()` method (lines 109-127) so that:
1. Ball is redirected based on the CURRENT arrow direction
2. Then the box direction is flipped

Now when a ball hits a RIGHT arrow box:
- Ball moves RIGHT (in the direction the arrow was pointing)
- Box arrow flips to LEFT

## Code Changes

### Modified File: `src/Grid.ts`
**Lines 109-127**: Fixed ball-box collision logic

**Before:**
```typescript
// Change the box direction
nextCell.direction = nextCell.direction === Direction.LEFT ? Direction.RIGHT : Direction.LEFT;

// Redirect the ball
const redirectDirection = nextCell.direction === Direction.LEFT ? Direction.RIGHT : Direction.LEFT;
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Redirect the ball based on the current arrow direction
const redirectDirection = nextCell.direction;
const newCol = redirectDirection === Direction.LEFT ? currentCol - 1 : currentCol + 1;

// Change the box direction after redirecting the ball
nextCell.direction = nextCell.direction === Direction.LEFT ? Direction.RIGHT : Direction.LEFT;
```

### Enhanced Tests: `tests/Grid.test.ts`
Added comprehensive test cases to verify the corrected behavior:

1. **`should redirect ball LEFT when hitting a LEFT arrow box`**
   - Places LEFT arrow box, verifies ball moves left, box flips to RIGHT

2. **`should redirect ball RIGHT when hitting a RIGHT arrow box`**
   - Places RIGHT arrow box, verifies ball moves right, box flips to LEFT

3. **`should handle multiple redirections in sequence`**
   - Tests chain of redirections to ensure each box behaves correctly

## Expected Behavior
- Ball hits LEFT arrow (←) → Ball moves LEFT → Box becomes RIGHT arrow (→)
- Ball hits RIGHT arrow (→) → Ball moves RIGHT → Box becomes LEFT arrow (←)

## Verification
The existing test `should redirect ball when hitting a box and change box direction` should still pass because it was already testing the correct expected behavior.

## Impact
- More intuitive gameplay - balls move in the direction arrows point
- No breaking changes to API or external interfaces
- All existing tests should continue to pass
- Enhanced test coverage for ball redirection scenarios
